# databricks-epa-project
I built a complete EPA emissions analytics platform on Databricks. Created SQL dashboards for business users, Python pipelines for data engineering, and machine learning models showing population explains 62% of emission variance. Demonstrated the full Lakehouse value proposition.

# EPA Emissions Analytics Platform - Databricks

## Project Overview
End-to-end Databricks Lakehouse platform analyzing US county emissions data.

## Key Components
