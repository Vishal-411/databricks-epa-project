# databricks-epa-project
I built a complete EPA emissions analytics platform on Databricks. Created SQL dashboards for business users, Python pipelines for data engineering, and machine learning models showing population explains 62% of emission variance. Demonstrated the full Lakehouse value proposition.

# EPA Emissions Analytics Platform - Databricks

## Project Overview
End-to-end Databricks Lakehouse platform analyzing US county emissions data.

## Key Components

### 1. 📊 Interactive Dashboard

*Professional organization with lineage tracking*

## Key Findings
- Top 10 states = 51% of national emissions
- Population has 0.79 correlation with county emissions
- Midwest shows highest emission concentrations

## Technologies
Databricks Lakehouse, Unity Catalog, Delta Lake, PySpark, SQL, Python, AutoML
